    @section install_overview Installation Overview

    Qorus Integration Engine&reg; is a self-contained application that is relatively easy to install.  The most
    complex part of the installation is the preparation of the database (covered in @ref dbconfigintro).

    @subsection install_overview_sysreqs Minimum System Requirements

    Qorus Installation Engine&reg; can be installed on a wide variety of UNIX/Linux systems as well as other operating
    systems when using <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> or <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a>
    containers (see the preceding section for more information and links about installing Qorus in containers).

    Minimum System Requirements:
    - CPU: x86_64 (64-bit) CPU
    - RAM: 2 GB RAM
    - Disk: 250 MB
    - Operating System: Linux or any operating system supporting <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> or
      or <a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a>

    The above minimum requirements are for a small installation with limited capabilities.  Large installations of
    Qorus Integration Engine&reg; require significantly more RAM and disk space.  For example,
    a very large Qorus Integration Engine&reg; installation might have 1TB of RAM spread over many containers, 10 GB
    of disk space for logs, and 500 GB of disk space for the database.

    @subsection install_java_sysreqs Java Requirements

    For Java support, Qorus requires <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK 11</a>, with the JDK installation
    where \c javac is available in the \c PATH.

    This is because Qorus interface code using Java is always delivered as source and is compiled when loaded into
    the system.  This ensures that Qorus can provide full source code transparency while also taking advantage of
    efficient Java byte code execution (as well as JIT).

    Jar and class files used by Qorus interfaces can be delivered in compiled form and do not have to be delived in
    source code form.

    @see @ref javadevelopment for more information

    @subsection install_overview_linuxreqs Linux Operating System Requirements

    Qorus Integration Engine&reg; {qorus_version} has a distributed architecture and requires a large number of
    descriptors for network communication and process entries for processes and threads.

    @subsubsection install_overview_linuxkernelreqs Linux Kernel Settings

    Ensure that the following kernel parameter is set to at least the following value (larger numbers are also OK):
    - <tt>fs.file-max = 5242880</tt>

    For Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Oracle Linux, and other Red Hat-based distributions, create or edit an
    appropriate file in \c /etc/sysctl.d with a line as above, and then run @verbatim /sbin/sysctl -p @endverbatim as
    \c root.

    For other Linuxes, create or edit \c /etc/sysctl.conf with a line as above, and then run
    @verbatim /sbin/sysctl -p @endverbatim as \c root; if this file does not exist, see your distribution's
    documentation about how to set kernel parameters.

    The recommended value for the kernel's maximum PID value is as follows (larger numbers are also OK):
    - <tt>kernel.pid_max = 131072</tt>

    If this value is too low, it can be changed as per the above instructions.

    @note
    - For Linux kernel 3+ the limit on the number of descriptors can be checked by typing:
      @verbatim cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max @endverbatim
      and the current number of descriptors in use can be checked by typing:
      @verbatim cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr @endverbatim
      this command returns three numbers: allocated file descriptors, free allocated file descriptors, and maximum
      file descriptors
    - For Linux kernel 3+ the limit on the number of processes can be checked by typing:
      @verbatim cat /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max @endverbatim

    @subsection install_overview_linuxuserreqs Linux User Limit Settings

    The user running Qorus Integration Engine&reg; {qorus_version} must have minimum hard and soft limits for the
    number of descriptors available (\c nofile) and the number of processes and threads (\c nproc).

    The minimum recommended soft limit values for each parameter are as follows:
    - <tt>nofile: 8192</tt>
    - <tt>nproc: 8192</tt>

    For Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Oracle Linux, and other Red Hat-based distributions, create or edit an
    appropriate file in \c /etc/security/limits.d as in the following examples:

    @par /etc/security/limits.d/20-nproc.conf
    @verbatim
* soft nproc 8192
root soft nproc unlimited
    @endverbatim

    @par /etc/security/limits.d/25-nofile.conf
    @verbatim
* soft nofile 8192
* hard nofile 16384
    @endverbatim

    Substitute \c "*" in the lines above with the application user name to set these limits for the Qorus user only.

    @note
    - If descriptors are not available, Qorus will not work properly; in the best case a deadlock will occur; it's
      critical to ensure that sufficient descriptors are available
    - \c nproc applies to processes and threads together, and each Qorus Integration Engine&reg; {qorus_version}
      process is multithreaded, therefore the \c nproc number must be significantly higher than the maximum number of
      Qorus processes running at any one time.
    - To check the hard limits for the number of descriptors (\c nofile) and the number of processes and threads
      (\c nproc) for your user, type:
      @verbatim ulimit -Hn -Hu @endverbatim
    - If multiple installations of Qorus Integration Engine&reg; {qorus_version} will be used on a single machine with
      a single Linux user, the above per-user limits should be raised accordingly
    - Qorus will start with lower limits, but when runtime limits exceed 80% of the system-defined limits, ongoing
      alerts are raised, and after this as the limit approaches the maximum value, Qorus will refuse to start
      interfaces.

    @subsection install_overview_linuxcgroupreqs Linux Control Group Settings

    For recent Linux distributions using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd">systemd</a> (including RedHat
    Enterprise Linux 8+ among others), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups">control group</a>
    \c TasksMax setting for the Qorus user must be set to a high enough number to allow for Qorus to run properly.

    This is particularly important on systems where Qorus is the primary application and will use the majority of the
    system's resources.

    The recommended number is <b><tt>65535</tt></b>.

    To set this, execute the following command as root:
    @verbatim systemctl set-property user-1000.slice TasksMax=65535 @endverbatim

    Substitute <b><tt>1000</tt></b> for the uid of the Qorus user; to find the uid; execute:
    @verbatim id qorus|cut -f2 -d=|cut -f1 -d\( @endverbatim

    Substitute <b><tt>qorus</tt></b> with the username of the qorus user.

    @subsection installdbreqs Database Requirements

    Qorus Integration Engine&reg; {qorus_version} requires a database for persistent storage.  The database server
    must be installed and configured separately to Qorus Integration Engine&reg; installation; this manual does not
    explain how to install and configure the database server in detail, but rather explains how to install and
    configure the Qorus system schema in an already-running database server.

    Qorus Integration Engine&reg; can use an Oracle, MySQL/MariaDB, or PostgreSQL database to store its system schema
    containing all user object (workflow, service, class definitions, etc) metadata and workflow state information.
    Instructions on how to install the database schema (once the database server software itself has been installed
    and configured) for Qorus on each supported database type are given in @ref schemapreparation.

    See the following sections for detailed requirements: @ref installoraclereqs "Oracle Requirements",
    @ref installmysqlreqs "MySQL/MariaDB Requirements", @ref installpgsqlreqs "PostgreSQL Requirements".

    @subsubsection installoraclereqs Oracle Requirements
    <i>Oracle Server Requirements</i>\n
    The Oracle database server must be 11.2 or higher.  Please note that Oracle Express Edition, available as a free
    of charge download from Oracle, and freely licensed for commercial use, is also supported for the database server.

    <i>Oracle Client Libraries</i>\n
    Oracle 11.2 or newer client shared libraries are required for Oracle functionality.  Qorus Integration
    Engine&reg;â€™s oracle module is dynamically linked with the Oracle client libraries, therefore earlier unsupported
    versions will not work.

    Oracle Instant Client (available as a free of charge for download from Oracle), Oracle client libraries from a
    11.2 or newer server installation, or Oracle client libraries from an Oracle Express Edition installation can be
    used.

    If Oracle Instant Client libraries are to be used, the following Oracle Instant Client package is required at a
    minimum:

    - \c instantclient-basic

    @note You must have the client installed for the same architecture as the Qorus server; for example, using Qorus
    x86_64 binaries requires x86_64 Oracle client libraries.  In general, 64-bit versions of Qorus cannot function
    with 32-bit Oracle client libraries.

    @subsubsection installmysqlreqs MySQL/MariaDB Requirements
    <i>MariaDB Server Requirements</i>\n
    The minimum supported version for the MySQL/MariaDB server is 5.1.  You cannot install Qorus {qorus_version} on
    earlier MySQL/MariaDB versions.

    <i>MariaDB Client Libraries</i>\n
    Support for MySQL/MariaDB is statically linked using MariaDB client libraries to the mysql module provided with
    Qorus Integration Engine&reg;.  MariaDB client support is provided under an open source license; no additional
    licenses are required.

    @subsubsection installpgsqlreqs PostgreSQL Requirements
    <i>PostgreSQL Server Requirements</i>\n
    The minimum supported version for the PostgreSQL server is 9.0.0.  You cannot install Qorus {qorus_version} on
    earlier PostgreSQL versions.

    <i>PostgreSQL Client Libraries</i>\n
    PostgreSQL client libraries are required to communicate with PostgreSQL servers; normally the same or newer
    version than the server should be used.

    @subsubsection installsybasereqs SAP / Sybase ASE Requirements

    SAP / Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise is not currently supported for the Qorus Integration Engine&reg; system
    schema.  You cannot install the Qorus Integration Engine&reg; system schema on a SAP ASE database; you can only
    communicate with SAP ASE databases from Qorus user code.

    SAP ASE Open Client 15 client libraries are required to communicate with SAP ASE servers using the \c "sybase"
    driver.  Qorus Integration Engine&reg;â€™s sybase module is dynamically linked with the SAP ASE Open Client 15
    client libraries, therefore no previous version will work.

    @note Sybase / SAP ASE databases can also be accessed using the @ref sybaseintro "freetds" driver included with
    Qorus (which also has the advantage of providing access to MS SQL Server DBs as well).

    @subsection first_time_installation_tasks First Time Installation Tasks

    It is recommended to setup the @link ##arch system.arch @endlink service and the \c qorus-archiver job to keep the
    live DB schema as small as possible as well as activating and configuring the \c qorus-log-rotator job to rotate
    and archive log files.

    To set up basic configuration with a 90-day data retention period and DB purging of older data as well as daily
    log rotation; \c bz2 archiving in the \c arch subdirectory, and 90-day log file retention, run the
    \c first_time_install.sh script in <tt>$OMQ_DIR/bin</tt>.

    From a Docker host this can be run as follows:
    @verbatim docker exec qorus bash --login -c first_time_install.sh @endverbatim

    From Kubernetes this can be run as follows:
    @verbatim kubectl exec deploy/qorus-core -- bash -l -c first_time_install.sh @endverbatim

    @note
    - These tasks are performed automatically when Qorus 6.0+ is installed for the first time in a new database
      schema; the \c first_time_install.sh script can be run after upgrading a Qorus installation to ensure that
      DB archiving and log rotation are enabled
    - The \c first_time_install.sh script runs <tt>schema-tool -m</tt> to do the setup work

    @section schemapreparation Database and Schema Preparation

    @subsection dbconfigintro Database Configuration Overview

    Regardless of the installation type (LSB or @ref tar), a database must be prepared to hold the Qorus system
    schema before the Qorus server can be started.

    Qorus Integration Engine&reg; requires at least the \c omq database schemas to operate, and also it's recommended
    to create the \c omquser schema as given in the following table.

    <b>Qorus Integration Engine&reg; System Schemas (Datasources)</b>
    |!%Schema|!Type|!Description
    |\c omq|Required|System schema, system and user metadata, workflow data will be installed here
    |\c omquser|Recommended|User-modifiable schema containing custom user objects; for initial installs, this schema \
        will be empty

    The system and user schemas can be created in different databases; they can even be of different database types.

    Each schema will be accessed through a datasource (see @ref dsconn), which represents a connection to a schema on
    a particular database server, using a particular username and password, as well as other optional information.

    The \c omq datasource must point to an Oracle, MySQL/MariaDB/Percona, or PostgreSQL database, but the \c omquser
    datasource has no restrictions on the database driver.

    Note that the database server does not necessarily have to be located on the same system as the Qorus Integration
    Engine&reg; server, however, for performance reasons, a fast network connection is required between the two
    systems at the minimum.

    @note Note that it is highly recommended that any Qorus Integration Engine&reg; database instance destined for
    production use should be in a clustered configuration to ensure the highest possible reliability.  Additionally,
    regular backups/dumps of the database should be made in case of a catastrophic database error.  All Qorus data,
    metadata, configuration and states, order data, etc, is stored in the system schema.  If the system schema becomes
    corrupted, Qorus will not function.

    Note that no changes can be made by the user to the Qorus system schema or Qorus may no longer function.  The
    optional user schema may be used in any way desired.

    The following sections will describe how to set up the system and user schemas for @ref oracleconfig "Oracle",
    @ref pgsqlconfig "PostgreSQL", and @ref mysqlconfig "MySQL/MariaDB/Percona" databases.

    @subsection install_dbsizing Database Sizing General Information

    Qorus database/tablespace sizing is highly dependent on the application architecture, the amount of workflow order
    instance data stored, the type and volume of data stored workflows and jobs, and the archiving frequency.

    @subsubsection install_archiving_best_practices Best Practices for Archiving

    - Setup the @link ##arch system.arch @endlink service and the \c qorus-archiver job to keep the live DB schema as
      small as possible.
    - Proactively resolve all workflow order instances with @ref OMQ::StatError "ERROR" statuses to ensure efficient
      archiving runs
    - Execute standard DBA tasks regularly (update statistics, vacuum on PostgreSQL, etc.)
    - Monitor usage of table segments and assign appropriate storage parameters to table(s) as necessary

    @note An archiving plan is a must for any Qorus instance; Qorus performance will suffer with very large databases
    caused by lack of archiving.

    @subsubsection install_dbsizing_formula Datbase Sizing Formula

    The following is a rough formula for determining the tablespace sizing for an initial install, assuming a
    conservatively large workflow order instance data size and data to index ratio:

    <tt>omq_data tablespace size = </tt><i>max. workflow order instances</i><tt> * 25 KB</tt>
    + <tt><i>max. job history records</i> * 10 KB</tt>\n
    <tt>omq_index tablespace size = </tt><i>omq_data tablespace size</i><tt> / 3</tt>

    The minumum recommended tablespace sizes for a test or evaluation instance are:

    <tt>omq_data: 256 MB</tt>\n
    <tt>omq_index: 128 MB</tt>

    The space used by system tables is different for each table depending on its function. See @ref datamodel
    - List of values (lookup) tables.
      - Static storage
      - Very small
    - Metadata tables
      - Tables containing metadata and source code for Qorus objects (workflows, jobs, instances)
      - Static storage most of the time
      - Small to medium
    - Instance tables
      - Tables containing order/instance data for each processing
      - OLTP
      - Large

    @subsubsection install_dbsizing_special_tables Database Planning for Special Tables

    This is a list if tables which may require special care by DBAs in very large installations with the most
    important tables listed first.

    The most critical table is the table holding workflow order data with columns \c staticdata and \c dynamicdata
    stored as large character objects (\c CLOB, \c TEXT depending on the DB server for the system schema):
    - \c ORDER_INSTANCE

    The following tables grow quickly in some circumstances as well:
    - \c WORKFLOW_INSTANCE
    - \c JOB_INSTANCE
    - \c ERROR_INSTANCE
    - \c SENSITIVE_ORDER_DATA (LOB)
    - \c ORDER_INSTANCE_KEYS
    - \c SENSITIVE_ORDER_DATA_KEYS

    Depending on the processing volume, the system may benefit from a custom storage setup for particular tables and
    data; while monitoring the system database, to optimize application performance, DBAs can consider establishing
    the following:
    - dedicated tablespace(s) for tables listed above
    - dedicated dedicated tablespace(s) for large objects
    - dedicated tablespace(s) for indexes

    @subsubsection install_dbsizing_example Database Sizing Example

    Consider a real life example of a system where there are many workflows used with large
    @ref staticdata "staticdata", @ref dynamicdata "dynamicdata", and @ref order_sensitive_data "sensitivedata":
    - workflow count: 360
    - overall DB size: 1 TB
    - \c ORDER_INSTANCE table size: 9 GB
      - \c dynamicdata LOB storage: 481 GB
      - \c staticdata LOB storage: 201 GB
    - archive DB size: 12 TB
    - retention period in the live schema: 1 month
    - retention period for the archive schema: 2 years

    @note Keeping data archived for 2 years as in the above example will have a large adverse impact on any queries
    that also search archived data due to the very large DB size required to store the data.  Additionally, every
    organization should review its data retention policies regarding sensitive data, as legal and regulatory
    requirements may impact the data archiving plan.  It is generally recommended to keep data in the live and archive
    schemas for as little time as possible for performance reasons.

    @subsection oracleconfig Oracle Configuration

    This step describes how to set up Oracle database schemas and tablespaces for use with Qorus Integration
    Engine&reg; on an Oracle 11.2 database server or later.  The creation of an Oracle instance is outside the scope
    of this documentation.  Use the \c dbca tool or see your Oracle documentation for more information.   However,
    %Qore Technologies highly recommends that any Qorus Integration Engine&reg; database instance destined for
    production use should be in a clustered configuration to ensure the highest possible reliability.

    The Qorus system datasources to be defined in the next step that will point to the schemas described here are
    \c omq (for the Qorus system schema) and optionally \c omquser (for the optional user schema).  The \c omq system
    schema is necessary for the operation of the system.

    @subsection oracleprivileges Oracle Privileges

    The priviledges described here apply to the system schema user (\c omq).  Example scripts for creating tablespaces
    and schema users follow in @ref exampleorauser.

    |!Name|!Mandatory|!Qorus Module|!Description

    |\c SELECT \c V$BUFFER_POOL_STATISTICS|No|@ref schema-tool|@ref schema-tool uses it for index tree analysis, but \
        it can also be handled by manually by a DBA

    @note
    - Oracle suggests using roles rather than raw GRANTs in its documentation; please consult your DBA when setting up
      new Oracle schemas
    - The names and passwords of the schemas can be set per installation; any valid Oracle name can be used.  In this
      document, the names \c omq and \c omquser will be used to refer to these schemas.  In the next step, the
      datasources \c omq and \c omquser will be set up to point to these schemas as well.

    @subsection oracletablespaces Oracle Tablespaces

    Each schema requires two tablespaces, one for data and one for indexes.  Tablespace names are flexible and do not
    necessarily have to be as described in the table below; tablespace names can be overridden with the \c â€“-data-ts
    and \c --index-ts options to the @ref oload "oload" and @ref schema-tool "schema-tool" programs and by default in
    the @ref options "options file" with the \c qorus-client.omq-data-tablespace and
    \c qorus-client.omq-index-tablespace options.  However, for the rest of this document, the names will appear as
    given below.

    |!%Schema|!Tablespace|!Type|!Description
    |\c omq|\c omq_data|Required|All system data is stored in the tablespace; this should be the default tablespace \
        for the \c omq user/schema, and the user must have permissions to write to this tablespace \
        (ie <tt>UNLIMITED TABLESPACE</tt> or a quota on this tablespace)
    |\c omq|\c omq_index|Required|All system index are stored here.
    |\c omquser|\c omquser_data|Optional|All data in the user schema is stored in this tablespace; this should be \
        the default tablespace for the \c omquser user/schema, and the user must have permissions to write to this \
        tablespace (ie <tt>UNLIMITED TABLESPACE</tt> or a quota on this tablespace)
    |\c omquser|\c omquser_index|Optional|All user indexes are stored here.

    @note If you use alternate tablespace names, you must define the tablespace names in the
    @ref options "options file" with the \c qorus-client.omq-data-tablespace and \
    \c qorus-client.omq-index-tablespace options so that automatic schema management will work properly

    @subsubsection oracletablespacesizing Oracle Tablespace Sizing

    See @ref install_dbsizing as an initial reference

    The optional \c omquser schema will be solely populated with user objects therefore the storage characteristics
    are installation-dependent and therefore no sizing information can be given here.  The Qorus development team and
    Oracle DBAs should confer and agree on sizing during the design and development process of workflows and services.

    To create the two required Oracle schemas and the tablespaces, SQL similar to that found in the
    \c $OMQ_DIR/templates/omq-db.sql and \c $OMQ_DIR/templates/omquser-db.sql can be used.  Note that the directory
    paths and file names should match your installation, and of course the tablespace sizes should match your
    planning.  These files are only given as examples and should not be used without modification for your environment
    and ideally should be verified by a DBA prior to execution.

    Oracle cluster configuration is outside the scope of this document (see your Oracle documentation instead), but a
    clustered database is recommended for production instances.

    Once the schemas and tablespaces have been created, verify the connectivity using \c $ORACLE_HOME/bin/sqlplus.

    @note As mentioned before, ensure that load balancing is not enabled in the \c tnsnames.ora file for the Qorus
    system schema.  The Qorus server must make all connections to the same physical database server as the Oracle
    cluster synchronization delay will cause problems with synchronized transaction management within the Qorus
    server.

    @subsection pgsqlconfig PostgreSQL Configuration

    This step describes how to set up PostgreSQL database schemas for use with Qorus Integration Engine&reg; on
    PostgreSQL server 9.0.0 or later.

    PostgreSQL installation and connectivity configuration (\c postgresql.conf, \c pg_hba.conf, etc configuration) is
    outside the scope of this documentation (however some basic information and examples are provided in the following
    section).  See your PostgreSQL documentation for detailed instructions on how to install the PostgreSQL database
    server.

    If the Qorus server and PostgreSQL servers are not located on the same machine, PostgreSQL must be configured to
    accept connections on a network interface so Qorus can communicate with the server.

    Once PostgreSQL has been installed and configured on the target system, Qorus databases, tablespaces, and users
    can be created.

    It is recommended to use UTF-8 character encoding in all PostgreSQL databases where international characters may
    be used with Qorus.

    Each schema requires two tablespaces, one for data and one for indexes.

    See @ref install_dbsizing

    Tablespace names are flexible and do not necessarily have to be as described in the table below; tablespace names
    can be overridden with the \c â€“-data-ts and \c --index-ts options to the @ref oload "oload" and
    @ref schema-tool "schema-tool" programs and by default in the @ref options "options file" with the
    \c qorus-client.omq-data-tablespace and \c qorus-client.omq-index-tablespace options.  However, for the rest of
    this document, the names will appear as given below.

    @note If you use alternate tablespace names, you must define the tablespace names in the
    @ref options "options file" with the \c qorus-client.omq-data-tablespace and
    \c qorus-client.omq-index-tablespace options so that automatic schema management will work properly

    <b>Required PostgreSQL Tablespaces</b>
    |!%Schema|!Tablespace|!Type|!Description
    |\c omq|\c omq_data|Mandatory|All system data is stored in the tablespace
    |\c omq|\c omq_index|Mandatory|All system index are stored here
    |\c omquser|\c omquser_data|Optional|All data in the user schema is stored in this tablespace
    |\c omquser|\c omquser_index|Optional|All user indexes are stored here

    <i>Example Database, Tablespace and User Creation Scripts</i>

    These files are provided as examples only; paths and passwords at least should be changed for security reasons.
    This example file can be found in \c $OMQ_DIR/templates/pgsql-omq-db.sql

    @verbatim
create database omq encoding = 'utf8';
\connect omq;
create tablespace omq_data location '/opt/postgresql90/db/omq_data';
create tablespace omq_index location '/opt/postgresql90/db/omq_index';
create user omq password 'omq';
grant create, connect, temp on database omq to omq;
grant create on tablespace omq_data to omq;
grant create on tablespace omq_index to omq;
grant select on all tables in schema pg_catalog to omq;
    @endverbatim

    This example file can be found in \c $OMQ_DIR/templates/pgsql-omquser-db.sql

    @verbatim
create database omquser encoding = 'utf8';
\connect omquser;
create tablespace omquser_data location '/opt/postgresql90/db/omquser_data';
create tablespace omquser_index location '/opt/postgresql90/db/omquser_index';
create user omquser password 'omquser';
grant create, connect, temp on database omquser to omquser;
grant create on tablespace omquser_data to omquser;
grant create on tablespace omquser_index to omquser;
grant select on all tables in schema pg_catalog to omquser;
    @endverbatim

    @note Do not forget to change the passwords to match your organization's security requirements.

    These files can be installed with the \c psql command as follows (use the appropriate user and password for your
    installation, the following are only examples):

    @verbatim
prompt$ psql â€“Upostgres < $OMQ_DIR/templates/pgsql-omq-db.sql
prompt$ psql â€“Upostgres < $OMQ_DIR/templates/pgsql-omquser-db.sql @endverbatim

    <i>Basic PostgreSQL Connectivity Configuration</i>

    Example pg_hba.conf File

    The following file allows connections to all databases and all users without a password for local users, and
    requires a username and password from all network users.  Do not use this file if local security is a concern:

    @verbatim
# CAUTION: Configuring the system for local "trust" authentication allows
# any local user to connect as any PostgreSQL user, including the database
# superuser. If you do not trust all your local users, use another
# authentication method.

# TYPE  DATABASE    USER        CIDR-ADDRESS          METHOD
# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all         all                               trust
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all         all         127.0.0.1/32          trust
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all         all         ::1/128               trust
# require a password from network users
host    all         all         0.0.0.0/0             md5
host	all         all         ::/0                  md5 @endverbatim

    If you need to connect to your PostgreSQL databases from other machines on the network, set the following in your
    \c postgresql.conf file to configure the server to listen on all network interfaces:

    @verbatim
listen_addresses = '*' @endverbatim

    For more information on these files, or on PostgreSQL security or configuration, see your PostgreSQL
    documentation.

    @subsection mysqlconfig MySQL/MariaDB/Percona Configuration

    Because MariaDB and Percona are a drop-in replacements for MySQL, references to MariaDB below are also valid for
    MySQL (which is an Oracle property; %Qore Technologies is not affiliated with Oracle) and Percona.  Any
    differences between MySQL, MariaDB, and Percona will be highlighted below.

    This step describes how to set up MariaDB database schemas for use with Qorus Integration Engine&reg; on MariaDB
    server 5.1 or later.  MariaDB installation is outside the scope of this documentation.  See your MariaDB
    documentation for detailed instructions on how to install the MariaDB database server.  Once MariaDB has been
    installed on the target system, Qorus databases and users can be created.

    It is recommended to use UTF-8 character encoding in all MariaDB databases where international characters may be
    used with Qorus.

    A case-sensitive collation must be used when creating the Qorus schema; the collation can be set as using the
    \c "collation" connection option as follows:

    @verbatim mysql:user/password@db(utf8)%hostname{collation=utf8_bin} @endverbatim

    @note
    - Both the DB encoding (used as <tt>character set</tt> when creating tables) and the collation must be given
      explicitly in the @ref systemdb option in the @ref options in order to ensure that tables are created correctly
      and that client connections will use the same encoding and collation, otherwise Qorus will not run properly
    - All MariaDB tables used in the Qorus Integration Engine&reg; system schema use the XtraDB (InnoDB for MySQL)
      engine for transaction management and row-level locking.

    Qorus imposes no restrictions on the database or user names used for either the system or user schemas when using
    MariaDB as a database server.

    <i>Example Database and User Creation Scripts</i>

    These files are provided as examples only, at least the passwords should be changed for security reasons.  This
    example file can be found in \c $OMQ_DIR/templates/mysql-omq-db.sql

    @verbatim
create user 'omq'@'%' identified by 'omq';
grant super on *.* to 'omq'@'%';
create user 'omq'@'localhost' identified by 'omq';
grant super on *.* to 'omq'@'localhost';

create database omq character set 'utf8';
grant all on omq.* to 'omq'@'%';
grant all on omq.* to 'omq'@'localhost'; @endverbatim

    This example file can be found in \c $OMQ_DIR/templates/mysql-omquser-db.sql

    @verbatim
create user 'omquser'@'%' identified by 'omquser';
grant super on *.* to 'omquser'@'%';
create user 'omquser'@'localhost' identified by 'omquser';
grant super on *.* to 'omquser'@'localhost';

create database omquser character set 'utf8';
grant all on omquser.* to 'omquser'@'%';
grant all on omquser.* to 'omquser'@'localhost'; @endverbatim

    @note Do not forget to change the passwords to match your organization's security requirements

    These files can be installed with the \c mysql command as follows (use the appropriate user and password, the
    following are only examples):

    @verbatim
prompt$ mysql â€“uroot < $OMQ_DIR/templates/mysql-omq-db.sql
prompt$ mysql â€“uroot < $OMQ_DIR/templates/mysql-omquser-db.sql @endverbatim

    @section installupgradetar Installing or Upgrading from TAR.GZ Packages

    @subsection installtar Installing From TAR.GZ Packages

    A first-time installation of Qorus Integration Engine&reg; from a tar.gz package involves preparing the file
    system and installing the system files.  Either preceding or following this, the
    @ref schemapreparation "system database schema must be prepared and populated".  This last topic is covered in
    @ref schemapreparation.

    From a high-level, the installation goes as follows:
    - create the application user (for UNIX/Linux systems)
    - create the application filesystem including log file directory
    - set up the user environment
    - do a partial install of the application to install templates for the configuration files
    - create/edit application configuration files

    Then the system database schema will be prepared and populated as follows:
    - prepare the system database schema (create database, users, covered in @ref schemapreparation)
    - install the system schema and system services (covered in @ref installtarinstall)

    @note Qorus Integration Engine&reg; as of version {qorus_version} supports load balancing and failover in
    Kubernetes and OpenShift and similar installations.

    @subsubsection installtaroverview Overview

    Before starting the system installation, ensure that you have the appropriate file from the following list
    containing binary support for your platform for Qorus Integration Engine&reg;.  Examples of compatible Linux
    distributions are: Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, OpenSUSE, Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.

    The release file, when unpacked, will create the files described in the following table in the subdirectory:
    - \c qorus-{qorus_version}/

    <b>Qorus Integration Engine&reg; TAR.GZ Release Manifest</b>
    |!File|!Description
    |\c install.sh|Installation script
    |\c qorus-{qorus_version}-Linux2.6-x86_64-binary.tar.gz|x86_64 Linux (kernel 2.6+) binaries
    |\c qorus-{qorus_version}-noarch.tar.gz|Common files
    |\c releases/qorus-{qorus_version}.qrf|System service load file

    Note that depending on the release package, only one of the above binary packages may be present in the release
    file.

    On UNIX/Linux systems, it is highly recommended that a new user be created for this installation.  The name for
    the user used in this documentation is \c qorus.

    @subsubsection installtarsysparams System Parameters
    Qorus can use many file descriptors, depending on the size of the installation.

    See @ref install_overview_linuxkernelreqs for information on Linux settings required for the proper operation
    of Qorus Integration Engine&reg;

    @subsubsection installtarprepareschema Prepare the System Schema

    <hr>
    <b>Step 1: Prepare Database User and Empty System %Schema</b>\n
    Prepare the system schema as described in @ref schemapreparation.

    Make sure and test the connection and have the connection parameters ready for use in
    @ref installtarinstall "Step 3: Install Qorus Application and Populate System Schema".

    <hr>
    <b>Step 2: Setup User and File System</b>\n
    The Qorus application itself takes less than 20 MB of disk space.

    Space must be planned for log directories that can fill up fast with busy systems, and for user code (workflow,
    service definitions, other Qorus user configuration files).

    50 MB is recommended for the Qorus Integration Engine&reg; application directory, and a minimum of 500 MB for the
    log directory, larger sizes can be necessary for larger installations, depending on the frequency of log rotation
    and the amount of logging done by the workflows and services running.

    The log directory can appear anywhere on the file system and does not have to be a subdirectory of the Qorus
    application directory, although the default log directory location is \c $OMQ_DIR/log.

    On UNIX/Linux system, a dedicated user is not required for the system, but it is highly recommended.  The username
    can be any valid user name, for the purposes of this document, the username \c qorus will be assumed.  The
    application directory could be the Qorus userâ€™s home directory or any other directory (for example: the mount
    point of a mounted filesystem) on the system.  In the examples in this document, the Qorus user \c qorus will have
    an application directory located in \c /opt/qorus.

    @note On all platforms the user running Qorus must have read and write access to the application directory and log
    directory trees.

    @subsubsection installtarenvvars Configure Environment Variables

    The following environment variables have to be set for the system to function properly.

    <b>Qorus System Environment Variables</b>
    |!Variable|!Description
    |\c OMQ_DIR|The main application directory
    |\c PATH|\c $OMQ_DIR/bin must appear in the path

    |\c QORE_CONNECTION_PROVIDERS|Must be set to \c "QorusConnectionProvider" in your system environment to take \
        advantage of the @ref qorusconnectionproviderintro "QorusConnectionProvider" module as a connection provider \
        to command-line programs so that Qorus @ref userconn "user connection" or \
        @ref remoteconn "remote connection" identifiers can be used instead of URL strings in %Qore programs like \
        \c rest and \c sfrest, etc
    |\c QORE_DATA_PROVIDERS|Must be set to \c "QorusDataProviders" in your system environment to use Qorus data \
        providers with the \c qdp program for command-line introspection and manipulation of data providers
    |\c QORE_DATASOURCE_PROVIDERS|Must be set to \c "QorusDatasourceProvider" in your system environment to take \
        advantage of the @ref qorusdatasourceproviderintro "QorusDatasourceProvider" module as a datasource provider \
        to command-line programs so that Qorus @ref dsconn "datasource" names can be used instead of full datasource \

        <tt>$OMQ_DIR/qlib:$OMQ_DIR/lib/modules:$OMQ_DIR/user/modules</tt> for the proper operation of the system so \
        that system user modules can be found; this is needed by the running server and for client programs.  \
        Multiple directories can be given separated by colons (\c ':')
    |\c QORUS_RELEASE_DIR|The directory for creating release packages with @ref make-release "make-release"; \
        defaults to \c $HOME/releases if not set

    If using the @ref oracleintro "oracle" driver for connectivity to Oracle databases, one of the following
    environment variables should be set depending on the Oracle client library used.

    <b>Environment Variables For Oracle Connectivity</b>
    |!Variable|!Description
    |\c ORACLE_HOME|For full Oracle installations, this variable must be set to the Oracle installationâ€™s home \
        directory.  This variable is not required for Oracle Instant Client installations.
    |\c TNS_ADMIN|With Oracle Instant Client only: set to the directory where the \c tnsnames.ora file is located.

    shells), \c .bash_profile for bash, the Bourne-Again Shell, or \c .cshrc (for csh-type shells).

    @subsubsection installtar_unix_env_var_example UNIX/Linux Environment Variable Examples

    <i>Bourne-Compatible Shell Example</i>\n
    Replace the application directories in the following example with the correct directories in your installation.

    @verbatim
# set OMQ_DIR to Qorus Integration Engine&reg; application directory
OMQ_DIR=/opt/qorus

# add Qorus library directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$OMQ_DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

# add Qorus bin directories to path
PATH="$OMQ_DIR/bin:$PATH"

# add Qorus qore language client library module dir to QORE_MODULE_DIR
QORE_MODULE_DIR="$OMQ_DIR/qlib:$QORE_MODULE_DIR"

# export all the changes made above
export OMQ_DIR LD_LIBRARY_PATH PATH QORE_MODULE_DIR
    @endverbatim

    @note Make sure that your Qorusâ€™ userâ€™s environment is configured to use the qore libraries shipped with or
    recommended for use with this version of Qorus Integration Engine&reg;.  This is particularly important if you
    have the open-source version of qore installed elsewhere on your system.  This can be accomplished by ensuring
    that \c $OMQ_DIR/lib appears first in your \c LD_LIBRARY_PATH.   Be sure to use the version of %Qore either
    shipped with Qorus or recommended for use with this version of Qorus, otherwise problems may result.

    <i>CSH-Compatible Example</i>\n
Replace the application directories in the following example with the correct directories in your installation.

    @endverbatim

    @subsubsection installtarinstall Install Qorus Application and Populate System Schema

    <hr>
    <b>Step 3: Install Qorus Application and Populate System Schema</b>\n
    Once the @ref schemapreparation "Qorus system database user and empty schema" have been prepared, the application
    user (if applicable) and application and log directories have been created and the environment has been properly
    set up for the application user, the application files can be installed and the system schema populated as
    described in this section.

    Log in as the Qorus user and make sure the environment is properly configured.  For example, execute:

    <b><i>UNIX/Linux Shell</i></b>
    @verbatim prompt% echo $OMQ_DIR @endverbatim

    @note environment variables are case-sensitive on UNIX/Linux

    The application directory should be output to your console.  If not, check your environment settings and try
    again.

    @note If the environment is not set up properly the installation may fail.  The application directory \c $OMQ_DIR
    must exist and be writable by the Qorus user.  Normally the Qorus user will be the owner of this directory, but
    regardless of ownership, the user running Qorus must have read/write access to the application and log directories.

    If all the prerequisites documented above are met, change directory to the location of the Qorus installation
    file, and uncompress the archive as follows:

    <b><i>UNIX/Linux Shell</i></b>
    @verbatim prompt% gunzip â€“dc qorus-{qorus_version}.tar.gz | tar xvf - @endverbatim

    This will create a subdirectory called qorus-{qorus_version} with contents as described in the manifest in the
    introduction to this manual.

    Change the current directory to the new directory extracted in the previous command:

    <b><i>UNIX/Linux Shell</i></b>
    @verbatim prompt% cd qorus-{qorus_version} @endverbatim

    In order to install the application file system in \c $OMQ_DIR and populate the system schema, the install script
    must be run with an option describing the initial connection to the system database.  Use the connection
    parameters for the system schema to substitute in the following command; note that arguments enclosed by square
    brackets are optional.  See the following table for the meaning of the required parameters in angle brackets.

    <b>Qorus Integration Engine&reg; Datasource Parameters</b>
    |!Parameter|!Description
    |\c driver|The driver to use for the connection, i.e. \c oracle, \c mysql, or \c pgsql
    |\c user|The username for the connection
    |\c pass|The password corresponding to the username
    |\c db|The database name
    |\c enc|The optional encoding to use for the connection in the format expected by the driver (i.e. \c AL32UTF8 \
        for \c UTF-8 with the oracle driver)
    |\c host|The optional hostname to use for the connection
    |\c port|The optional port number to use for the connection

    Note that if the data and index tablespace names for the system schema are not named \c omq_data and \c omq_index
    respectively, then the <tt>--data-ts=</tt><i>data_tablespace_name</i> and
    <tt>--index-ts=</tt><i>index_tablespace_name</i> options must be given as well.

    Install the files and populate the initial database schema by executing the following command:

    <b><i>Install.sh Arguments</i></b>
    <tt>./install.sh [<i>oload args...</i>]</tt>

    If the environment is properly configured, output will appear as follows:

    After successfully running \c install.sh, the Qorus Integration Engine&reg; directory layout is installed as
    described in @ref tar "tar".

    @subsection upgradetar Upgrading a TAR.GZ Installation

    This section describes upgrading a Qorus Integration Engine&reg; installation from tar.gz files.

    @subsubsection upgradetarprereqs Prerequisites

    Upgrading a Qorus Integration Engine&reg; installation to version {qorus_version} is supported from any publicly
    released version of Qorus.  Furthermore, it is assumed that the Qorus userâ€™s environment is already properly set
    up, as it should be for an existing installation.

    @note When upgrading the system must be shut down prior to the upgrade because the system schema will be upgraded
    to v{datamodel_version}, and this cannot be performed while the system is running.

    @subsubsection upgradetarupgrade Perform Upgrade

    To upgrade Qorus Integration Engine&reg; to {qorus_version}, change directory to the location of the Qorus
    Integration Engine&reg; {qorus_version} installation file, and uncompress the archive as follows:

    <b><i>UNIX/Linux Shell</i></b>
    @verbatim prompt% gunzip â€“dc qorus-{qorus_version}.tar.gz | tar xvf - @endverbatim

    This will create a subdirectory called qorus-{qorus_version} with contents as described in the manifest in the
    introduction to this manual.

    To create the application file system in \c $OMQ_DIR, execute the following commands:

    <b><i>UNIX/Linux Shell Example</i></b>
    @verbatim
